		<string>— City utility department, Mary Chambers speaking. How may I help you?
— Yes, I&apos;m new to the city and I&apos;m trying to figure out how garbage and recycle collection work. It&apos;s my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recylables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?
— No sir, it&apos;s the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.

		<string>— Morning, Sally. Did you have a good weekend?
— Yes, I did. On Saturday we went hiking at Trout Lake, and yesterday we saw Titanium Man.
— Oh I&apos;ve seen that. Isn&apos;t it great? The action scenes were awesome! And I think Richard Crowley Jr. should win the Oscar for best actor!
— Yeah, Crowley Jr. was superb. But I thought the movie was so-so. It was too long, and wasn&apos;t as suspenseful as I thought.</string>

— Preston, it&apos;s good to see you again! I&apos;ve been away most of the summer, doing professional development training. The company sent me to Ohio to learn about database programming so that I can transform our current accounting procedures.
— Really? That sounds great. I&apos;m hoping to take a sabbatical too next year too... in Florida. Would you mind if I asked you some questions about your experience this summer?
— Not at all. Let&apos;s do lunch, and you can fill me in on everything that I missed while I was away. It looks like the fifteenth floor has been renovated.</string>

gas company and ask if the rates have gone up.
