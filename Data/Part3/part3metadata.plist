		<string>— City utility department, Mary Chambers speaking. How may I help you?
— Yes, I&apos;m new to the city and I&apos;m trying to figure out how garbage and recycle collection work. It&apos;s my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recylables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?
— No sir, it&apos;s the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.

— Yes, I did. On Saturday we went hiking at Trout Lake, and yesterday we saw Titanium Man.
— Oh I&apos;ve seen that. Isn&apos;t it great? The action scenes were awesome! And I think Richard Crowley Jr. should win the Oscar for best actor!

		<string>— So in summary Michael, your review is mostly favorable. You met four of your seven incentive goals, which means your bonus will total $3,000. You got high marks for promptness and dedication, and need to improve your business etiquette and time management. Do you have any questions?
— Yes, just a couple. What do you do with my performance review after I review it and sign it? Will you use it next year in deciding on salary increases?
— Those are good questions. Your review will go into your file, which is part of your permanent employment record. It will be considered in determining salary, but it&apos;s just one factor among many. We&apos;ll also consider your overall performance since you joined the company, and any improvement made following this evaluation. In general, you&apos;re doing very nice work. Keep up the good work, and you shouldn&apos;t have any worries.
— Thank you, Ms. Donaldson. I appreciate your fairness, and I enjoy working for you.</string>

		<string>— Here are the steps for reimbursing travel expenses. First, you need to fill out a travel voucher, that&apos;s the blue form here. Take that to your manager, and get his or her signature on the bottom line. Then, take a copy of that form -- that&apos;s the yellow page underneath -- and turn it into accounting. Be sure to attach copies of all your receipts. You keep the third page, the pink form, along with all your original receipts. Reimbursement checks are cut once a month, and they are separate from your normal paycheck. They usually go out on the 15th.
— OK, blue form to manager, yellow to accounting. I think I&apos;ve got it. What type of expenses will the company reimburse?
— Typically taxi, subway and bus fares; admission fees; meals and drinks up to $30 a day; and any necessary business supplies -- either for use on your trip or after you return. Of course, we&apos;ll also reimburse for unexpected costs, such as having to rent a hotel room if your flight is cancelled or delayed, or expenses associated with a lost wallet or natural disaster.</string>

— It&apos;d be a good idea to use a vendor that offers ongoing technical support. I know that Ingram Computers has an excellent reputation for customer service, and they have a comprehensive parts replacement warranty. During the warranty period, if something goes wrong they&apos;ll replace your computer outright or else lend you a computer while they repair yours.

		<string>— Can you help me please? My flight to Boston&apos;s been delayed until 8 o&apos;clock, but I need to be there by 5. Do you have any other flights I can take?
— We have flights that leave at 2 and 3:30. But they&apos;re both full. I could book you on standby for each of them. If someone doesn&apos;t show up, you can have their seat.
— What do you think my chances are of getting on? I have an important meeting that I really can&apos;t miss.
— Well, there are two passengers ahead of you on the standby list. If you want to make sure you get to Boston on time, I could refund your money and you could try another airline.</string>
