		<string>Mike Mannequin here with a KRKR news update. The Senate will vote today on a bill to bail out the nation&apos;s farmers. The bill passed the House of Representatives last week in a very close vote. The president has said he will sign the bill if it passed. Locally, work crews are still cleaning up debris from last week&apos;s flooding in the eastern part of the state. The governor has declared the flood spots a disaster area, and asked the federal government for financial help. In sports, State and Tech universities are preparing for tomorrow&apos;s annual showdown to see who takes home the Silver Cup. Kickoff is at noon, and you can hear the game right here on KRKR 550 AM. I&apos;m Mike Mannequin in the news center. Stay tuned for traffic and weather after this word from our sponsor.</string>

		<string>Hello, this message is for Dick Lyons. My name is Janelle Archer from Lincoln Bank, and you had called us asking about interest rates for our CDs and money market accounts. Our current top CD rate is 5 percent for 48 months, with a minimum investment of $5,000. We also offer a CD of 4 percent for 36 months, with a minimum of $2,000. To purchase either of these CDs, you must first have a Lincoln Bank checking account. Our money market account is currently paying an interest rate of 3.50 percent. You don&apos;t need a previous checking account to open a money market account, but you do have to make an initial deposit of at least $1,000. I hope this answers your questions, Mr. Lyons. If there&apos;s anything else I can help you with, please give me a call. My name&apos;s Janelle Archer, and my number is 555-2002. Have a great day.</string>

		<string>OK, let&apos;s go over a few important details. First, do you all have your employee handbook? If you need one, go see Ms. Chambers in HR right away. Please read your handbooks, sign the form on the back page, and return those to the HR department by the end of the day Friday. Next, timesheets are to be turned in to your department manager by 5 p.m. each Friday. It&apos;s your responsibility to make sure they are filled out properly. If they aren&apos;t, your paycheck will be delayed. If you have any expense vouchers or overtime documentation sheets, paper clip - do not staple - them, to the back of your timesheet. Overtime must be pre-approved by your direct supervisor, and you have to get a documentation sheet from the supervisor before working the overtime hours. Pay days are the 15th and 30th of each month, or the closest Friday if one of those dates falls on a weekend. Finally, please note carefully company policy in regard to keeping your work stations clean and projecting a professional appearance in your personal dress.</string>

		<string>Clinton City has announced delays and closures for schools due to the big snowstorm this morning. All public elementary, middle and high schools will begin two hours late. Because of ice on the roads, buses will pick children up at their special snow-stop locations, instead of the regular bus stops. If you do not know where your child&apos;s snow bus stop is, call the district transportation office at 555-3343. Schools will end at the regular time, but all after-school activities today have been cancelled. Buses will deliver students to their snow-stop locations. All private elementary, middle and high schools have cancelled school today. Community colleges, as well as City University, will begin one hour late this morning.

		<string>How do we attract and retain customers? That&apos;s a great question, and for a retailer, probably the most crucial one to address. First, we pay a lot of attention to detail -- the way our stores look, the lighting, the cleanliness. Is the parking lot clean? Are the signs visible and easy to read? Second, we invest in our associates. We pay merit increases, we pay bonuses, and make contributions to their retirement plans. We believe that satisfied workers equals satisfied customers. We just introduced something we call power hours. In the hours that traffic is heaviest, we stop all activity that the customers can&apos;t see, like back-room unloading and storing, and put every associate out on the main floor. It&apos;s really that belly-to-belly experience that makes people want to come back. We hear from about 100,000 customers each week, and they rate us on a number of attributes. So far, they tell us that we&apos;re doing the right things.</string>

		<string>Looking at our county-wide traffic map, we see that traffic is crawling along the valley freeway right now, as well as the southbound lanes of Interstate 6. Elsewhere it looks pretty good, with volumes on northbound Interstate 6 beginning to build up here, near Headport, and again here south of the city near Duwamps. A check of the KAPE real-time camera shows a smooth commute at this hour through downtown Floss. Now, switching to the eastside camera, we can see a stalled vehicle backing up traffic on State Route 7. But I see flashing lights, so help is on the scene. That&apos;s traffic at this hour, still pretty light but starting to build. I&apos;m Ross Dinsmore for KAPE news.</string>

		<string>The reason we&apos;re meeting today is to introduce the plan for our new office layout. Starting next month, instead of cubicles, we will have an open office. There will be no cubicle walls or partitions. Instead, desks will be arranged in clusters for each department. The desks in each department will be facing each other in clusters of four or six. We feel this will facilitate better communication between workers in each departments. It will also create a more welcoming environment for clients. The department managers will still have their own offices, but each will have large windows and glass doors, to make employees and clients feel welcome to come inside. We&apos;re also going to paint the walls and put in new carpeting. The project will start on the first of next month and should take about three weeks to complete. We will be moving to the third floor during that period.</string>

		<string>I&apos;d like to focus a little bit on the year ahead. Starting in January, we will place increased emphasis on retaining customer deposits. We will be raising the rates on our certificates of deposits from 3 percent to 3.5 percent, and offering customers incentives, including free ipods, for opening new checking accounts with direct deposits. This is in response to the aggressive push by online depositories and credit unions, which are enticing customers with higher interest rates. This is squeezing our interest margin and decreasing our profitability. We can&apos;t lend money that we don&apos;t have, right? At the same time, we will be switching the title of &quot;loan officers&quot; to &quot;relationship officers.&quot; A large part of their job now will be to recruit, and retain, new deposits.</string>

		<string>Thank you all for coming. After considering several factors, including the questionnaires you completed last spring, we&apos;ve decided that we&apos;re going to switch to four-day workweeks, beginning next month. We will work 10 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., on Monday through Thursday. The office will be closed Fridays. Though we will still work 40 hours a week, we estimate that this change will reduce our energy use by 15 percent, and will also save each of you, on average, about $20 a month in gas and transportation costs. Overall, this change will significantly cut our company&apos;s greenhouse transmissions and reduce our carbon footprint. To save even more energy, we will be installing compact fluorescent light bulbs -- CFLs -- in every light socket at the start of next week. During the changeover period, we understand that some of you, particularly those with young children, might need special accommodations as you adjust to a four-day week. If you have troubles or concerns, let your manager know. We&apos;ll be happy to help you any way we can. Though this might be traumatic at first, we&apos;re confident that most of you will like the new schedule once you&apos;ve grown accustomed to the change.</string>

		<string>This is Tom Moran with a KST-AM traffic update. Volume on the two major east-west roadways, Interstate 50 and Highway 44, is very heavy this afternoon as people head out of town for the holiday weekend. There are no accidents on either road, but on Interstate 50 there is a 90-minute delay getting over the mountain pass. North-south traffic looks good at this hour. Interstate 3 is mostly clear in both directions, with a little slowing northbound near the City Center exit due to an earlier two-car collision that has been moved off to the shoulder. We&apos;re getting reports now of a backup on Highway 10 southbound near Rodgers Street, where some furniture has fallen off the back of a pickup truck in the far left lane. Police are on the scene, helping the driver pick everything up. This is Tom Moran from the KST-AM traffic center, which provides traffic updates every 20 minutes.</string>

		<string>Kathy Hendricks here with a live birds-eye traffic update, brought to you by Tri-State Insurance Company. Interstate 12 is flowing smoothly again now that cars involved in an earlier accident have been cleared to the shoulder, but volume on State Route 95 is starting to build. Traffic there is backed up near the city center exit due to a stalled vehicle in the right lane, and again north of the city due to a two-car injury accident on the Statesville off ramp. Interstate 1 is bumper-to-bumper on the bridge crossing the river, where work crews are re-paving part of the roadway. All other major routes look good right now, though traffic on Vine Street near the freeway entrance is slowing because of a malfunctioning traffic light. For KOKO, this is Kathy Hendricks with birds-eye traffic.</string>

		<string>This is meteorologist George Bennett in the KOPS weather center. Well, summer&apos;s over and it&apos;s time to break out the umbrellas. As you can see on this KOPS satellite image, a storm front is pushing this way from the coast, bringing heavy rain and winds tonight, followed by afternoon showers tomorrow after some morning clearing. Highs will be 60 degrees today and 65 tomorrow, while lows both days will dive into the low 40s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure system moving in from the south will bring more rain later in the week, interspersed with periods of partial clearing. Highs toward the end of the week will inch down toward 60, with lows possibly reaching the mid-30s. As we look out over the eastern part of the state, things look dryer there, with no rain expected and highs holding steady in the mid- to upper-70s for the next week or so.</string>

		<string>We are pleased to announce the grand opening of our company&apos;s new day-care center, located on the third floor next to the lunch room. The center is open to employees&apos; children between the ages of 2 and 5. Starting next Monday, eligible employees can drop off their youngsters at the day-care center beginning at 7 a.m., and pick them up no later than 6 p.m. The cost is $20 an hour per child, and includes lunch and snacks. For those who work part-time, half-day and drop-in options are available. Our center features six experienced teachers, and includes modern play equipment and learning materials. It has 3,000 square feet, including a main play area, a lunch room, and three separate class rooms: one for two- and three-year-olds, one for four-year-olds, and one for five-year-olds. Don&apos;t worry, moms and dads. Your children will be safe, warm, and, best of all, nearby! You are welcome to visit them on the third floor during lunch hour and work breaks.</string>
