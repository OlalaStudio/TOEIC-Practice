		<string>Mike Mannequin here with a KRKR news update. The Senate will vote today on a bill to bail out the nation&apos;s farmers. The bill passed the House of Representatives last week in a very close vote. The president has said he will sign the bill if it passed. Locally, work crews are still cleaning up debris from last week&apos;s flooding in the eastern part of the state. The governor has declared the flood spots a disaster area, and asked the federal government for financial help. In sports, State and Tech universities are preparing for tomorrow&apos;s annual showdown to see who takes home the Silver Cup. Kickoff is at noon, and you can hear the game right here on KRKR 550 AM. I&apos;m Mike Mannequin in the news center. Stay tuned for traffic and weather after this word from our sponsor.</string>

		<string>Hello, this message is for Dick Lyons. My name is Janelle Archer from Lincoln Bank, and you had called us asking about interest rates for our CDs and money market accounts. Our current top CD rate is 5 percent for 48 months, with a minimum investment of $5,000. We also offer a CD of 4 percent for 36 months, with a minimum of $2,000. To purchase either of these CDs, you must first have a Lincoln Bank checking account. Our money market account is currently paying an interest rate of 3.50 percent. You don&apos;t need a previous checking account to open a money market account, but you do have to make an initial deposit of at least $1,000. I hope this answers your questions, Mr. Lyons. If there&apos;s anything else I can help you with, please give me a call. My name&apos;s Janelle Archer, and my number is 555-2002. Have a great day.</string>

		<string>OK, let&apos;s go over a few important details. First, do you all have your employee handbook? If you need one, go see Ms. Chambers in HR right away. Please read your handbooks, sign the form on the back page, and return those to the HR department by the end of the day Friday. Next, timesheets are to be turned in to your department manager by 5 p.m. each Friday. It&apos;s your responsibility to make sure they are filled out properly. If they aren&apos;t, your paycheck will be delayed. If you have any expense vouchers or overtime documentation sheets, paper clip - do not staple - them, to the back of your timesheet. Overtime must be pre-approved by your direct supervisor, and you have to get a documentation sheet from the supervisor before working the overtime hours. Pay days are the 15th and 30th of each month, or the closest Friday if one of those dates falls on a weekend. Finally, please note carefully company policy in regard to keeping your work stations clean and projecting a professional appearance in your personal dress.</string>
